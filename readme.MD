🎨 Beautifully personal. Ethically built. Technically rigorous.

- 🔒 Privacy-first: nothing is remembered unless you add it.
- 🧠 Deliberate memory: add opinions, preferences, facts as discrete memories.
- ⚖️ Trust-weighted: memories carry trust scores to shape answers.
- 🔎 Explainable: responses reference the memories that influenced them.
- 🛡️ Reduced hallucination: generation uses only relevant, high‑trust memories.

## How it works — at a glance
1. You (or a trusted trainer) add a memory: a short text + metadata.  
2. Each memory is converted to an embedding and stored in a vector DB.  
3. During chat the system retrieves the top‑K most relevant, trust‑weighted memories.  
4. The model conditions on those results (and ephemeral convo) to generate a grounded, explainable reply.  
5. Conversations stay ephemeral; long‑term memory grows only by deliberate action.
