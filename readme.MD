# Mimic

Privacy‑first AI avatars that grow only with your explicit, trusted inputs. Instead of passive learning, Mimic stores user‑added memories as embeddings and recalls the most relevant, trust‑weighted items to generate responses — minimizing hallucination while preserving personality and control.

## Highlights
- Privacy-first: nothing is remembered unless you add it.
- Trusted memories: add, edit, and weight memories to shape identity.
- Explainable: responses cite which memories influenced them.
- Minimal hallucination: only relevant, high‑trust memories are used.
- Human-centered growth: conversations remain ephemeral; long-term memory is deliberate.

## Philosophy
AI should reflect people, not generic patterns. Mimic separates short-term chat from long-term memory so your avatar evolves transparently and ethically.

## Try it
Add a memory (preference, opinion, fact) and start a conversation — see which memories were used to form each reply.
